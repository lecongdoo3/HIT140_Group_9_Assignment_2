# Group Assessment 2 for unit HIT140 - Group 9
## Objective
The goal of this project is to Diagnosing Parkinson’s Disease using voice sample data analysis. Hence, we are going to build machine learning models to predict UPDRS scores (motor and total).

## Data
We use a dataset provided by our lecturer in a CSV file. The original study collected the voice recordings of 42 subjects with early-stage Parkinson’s disease, with each participant contributing between 101 and 168 voice samples. These samples were then broken down into various acoustic characteristics using a software named Praat.

## Methodology
We first used simple linear regression as a baseline model, then, after realising the R-squared is too low, we decided to build multiple linear regression models. 

## Results


## Installation and usage guide
numpy: Used for numerical operations.

pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

matplotlib: For plotting and visualization.

statistics: Provides functions to compute mathematical statistics of numeric data.

scipy: Used for high-level computations. Specifically, scipy.stats is being imported here.

statsmodels: Provides classes and functions for the estimation of statistical models.

To install these packages (if you haven't already), you can use 'pip'.

For example: pip install matplotlib

## Acknowledgement
We'd like to express our gratitude to our lecturer Dr. Yakub Sebastian at CDU for his invaluable guidance and insights throughout the duration of this project.
